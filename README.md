## Description

🪝[Quick-Referance-I.D.] 
- given prompts through the terminal, the user will be able to interat with a companies employee tracker to add, 
  update, and view differnt  parts of the companies departments.

🪝[In-Depth-I.D.] 
- The main reason in making this would be to demonstrate how to combine the usage of Node, Inquirer, and SQL.
- The project stands out to me by being an early introduction to how multiple languages and tools are working togther on a single database.
- Here in this project the main points that I learned would be how to use postgres SQL and how to properly adapt its use of a database with node packages that I am familier 
  with.
